- Allow 'cancel' subcommand to take many order IDs.

## [0.3.0] - 2017-03-13
### Changed
- Include timezone in timestamp outputs.

## [0.2.5] - 2017-03-13
### Changed
- Silence 'EAPI:Invalid nonce' errors while in cron mode.

## [0.2.4] - 2017-02-13
### Changed
- Catch http.client.BadStatusLine while querying Kraken's API and silence it while in cron mode.

## [0.2.3] - 2016-12-29
### Changed
- Catch ValueError while querying Kraken's API and silence it while in cron mode.

## [0.2.2] - 2016-12-11
### Added
- Add a `--cron` option that downgrades errors related to the communication with Kraken's API (for example TimeoutError or ConnectionResetError) from ERROR to INFO level. Together with the change described below, this means that those errors are now sent to stdout instead of stderr when cron mode is active. So you can use the new option together with `1>/dev/null` in a cron script and avoid being spammed when Kraken is not available.

### Changed
- Logging now sends DEBUG and INFO messages to stdout, and WARNING and above to stderr (previously all was sent to stderr).
- If available, call `win_unicode_console.enable()` to fix issues with unicode characters in Windows console.

### Added
- New environment variable CLIKRAKEN_DEFAULT_PAIR to override the default currency pair.
- New environment variable CLIKRAKEN_API_KEYFILE to override the default keyfile location.
- New environment variable CLIKRAKEN_USER_SETTINGS_PATH to override the default user settings file location.
- Add short alias "p" for the "place" command.
- Do proper logging of info/warning/error messages.
- Log lines will be colorized on terminal if colorlog is available (pip install colorlog).

### Changed
