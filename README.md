# clikraken

Command-line client for the Kraken exchange

This command line client allows you to get useful public and private information
from Kraken's API and displays it in formatted tables.

Moreover you can place or cancel simple orders
(only simple buy/sell market/limit orders are currently implemented).

It is mainly oriented as an alternative to manually entering orders on Kraken's webpages, to save some time and eliminate mouse clicks. It is not optimized for automated use.

See package on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clikraken

**WARNING**: This software is currently in development.
I consider it in _alpha_ state, which means that it works well enough for me but hasn't been thoroughly tested.
There are probably undetected bugs left. **Use at your own risk!**

## Installation

### Step 0: Create a virtualenv (optional)

You can install it in a virtualenv if you wish to keep this program and dependencies isolated from the rest of your system, but that's not mandatory.

```
mkdir -p ~/.venv  # or any folder of your choice
pyvenv ~/.venv/clikraken
```

And activate it:

```
source ~/.venv/clikraken/bin/activate
```

### Step 1: Install clikraken

```
pip install clikraken
```

If everything went well, `clikraken --version` should output the program's version without error.

### Step 2: Add your API key in the file `~/.config/clikraken/kraken.key`

You will need it to perform private queries to the Kraken API.

(Create the config folder if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.config/clikraken`)

```
keykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykey
secretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecretsecret
```

You should probably change the permissions to this file to protect it: `chmod 600 ~/.config/clikraken/kraken.key`

Alternatively, you can set a path in the environment variable `CLIKRAKEN_API_KEYFILE` to override the default keyfile location.

### Step 3 (optional): Generate a settings file and adapt it to your needs

clikraken looks for settings in `~/.config/clikraken/settings.ini` per default. 

If the settings file doesn't exist yet, default settings are assumed. You can see the default settings by calling `clikraken generate_settings`. Currently these settings are mostly useful for defining the default currency pair to use if the option `--pair` (or `-p`) is not provided. *The current built-in default pair is XETHZEUR* (Ethereum/Euro). You may want to change that if you are mostly trading with another currency pair. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `CLIKRAKEN_DEFAULT_PAIR` to override the default currency pair.

You can generate your `settings.ini` by doing the following:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/clikraken # only if the folder doesn't exist yet
clikraken generate_settings > ~/.config/clikraken/settings.ini
```

Alternatively, you can set a path in the environment variable `CLIKRAKEN_USER_SETTINGS_PATH` to override the default user settings file location.

## Usage

If installed in a virtualenv, don't forget to activate it first: `source ~/.venv/clikraken/bin/activate` (When you are done using clikraken, you can deactivate the virtualenv with `deactivate`.)

This command line client works by calling subcommands with their respective options and arguments (similar to git).

Get help to see the available subcommands:

```
clikraken --help
```

Output:

```
usage: clikraken.py [-h] [-V] [--raw]
                    {generate_settings,ticker,t,depth,d,last_trades,lt,balance,bal,place,p,cancel,x,olist,ol,clist,cl}
                    ...

clikraken - Command line client for the Kraken exchange

positional arguments:
  {generate_settings,ticker,t,depth,d,last_trades,lt,balance,bal,place,p,cancel,x,olist,ol,clist,cl}
                        available subcommands
    generate_settings   [clikraken] Print default settings.ini to stdout
    ticker (t)          [public] Get the Ticker
    depth (d)           [public] Get the current market depth data
    last_trades (lt)    [public] Get the last trades
    balance (bal)       [private] Get your current balance
    place (p)           [private] Place an order
    cancel (x)          [private] Cancel an order
    olist (ol)          [private] Get a list of your open orders
    clist (cl)          [private] Get a list of your closed orders

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program version
  --raw                 output raw json results from the API
  --cron                activate cron mode (tone down errors due to timeouts
                        or unavailable Kraken service)

To get help about a subcommand use: clikraken SUBCOMMAND --help
For example:
    clikraken place --help

Current default currency pair: XETHZEUR.

Create or edit the setting file /home/zertrin/.config/clikraken/settings.ini to change it.
If the setting file doesn't exist yet, you can create one by doing:
    clikraken generate_settings > /home/zertrin/.config/clikraken/settings.ini

You can also set the CLIKRAKEN_DEFAULT_PAIR environment variable
which has precedence over the settings from the settings file.
```

Each subcommand has different optional arguments, to get information on how to use a subcommand:

```
clikraken SUBCOMMAND --help
```

For example, the `place` subcommand has the following help:

```
usage: clikraken.py place [-h] [-p PAIR] [-t {market,limit}] [-s STARTTM]
                          [-e EXPIRETM] [-q] [-v]
                          {sell,buy} volume [price]

positional arguments:
  {sell,buy}
  volume
  price

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PAIR, --pair PAIR  asset pair (default: XETHZEUR)
  -t {market,limit}, --ordertype {market,limit}
                        order type. Currently implemented: [limit, market].
                        (default: limit)
  -s STARTTM, --starttm STARTTM
                        scheduled start time (default: 0)
  -e EXPIRETM, --expiretm EXPIRETM
                        expiration time (default: 0)
  -q, --viqc            volume in quote currency (default: False)
  -v, --validate        validate inputs only. do not submit order (default:
                        False)
```

### Usage examples

Notice: Without the `-p` option, default currency pair is taken from the settings file or the aforementionned environment variable, defaulting to `XETHZEUR` if neither of those exists.

```
clikraken ticker
clikraken balance
clikraken depth

clikraken place buy -t limit 0.42 11.1337
clikraken place buy -t market 0.1

# without the -t option, defaults to limit orders
clikraken place sell 0.5 13.3701

clikraken cancel OUQUPX-9FBMJ-DL7L6W
```

Examples in another currency pair:

```
# BTC/EUR currency pair
clikraken ticker -p XXBTZEUR
clikraken depth -p XXBTZEUR
clikraken place buy 0.08 587.12 -p XXBTZEUR
clikraken olist -p XXBTZEUR

# ETH/BTC currency pair
clikraken ticker -p XETHXXBT
clikraken depth -p XETHXXBT
clikraken last_trades -p XETHXXBT
```

## Upgrade

```
pip install -U clikraken
```

## Requirements

Python 3.4+

clikraken was developped with Python 3.4 and is tested with Python 3.4 to 3.6. Future Python versions should be compatible but haven't been tested yet.

There is no plan to support Python 2 at all and it's unlikely that Python 3.0 to 3.3 will ever be supported. Sorry!

clikraken has been tested on Linux (Debian Jessie) and Windows 7. I guess it should work with other systems but your mileage may vary.

### Dependencies

The dependencies should be automatically installed when installing clikraken with pip.
But if working in a fresh environment (for example after cloning the source code to develop), you may need to install these manually with pip.
